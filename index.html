          <h2>Queen Of Melody</h2>
          <p>
            Lata Mangeshkar (born as Hema Mangeshkar; 28 September 1929 – 6 February 2022)[7] was an Indian playback singer and occasional music composer. She is widely considered to have been one of the greatest and most influential singers in India.[8][9] Her contribution to the Indian music industry in a career spanning seven decades gained her honorific titles such as the "Queen of Melody", "Nightingale of India", and "Voice of the Millennium".[10]

           <h2>Early Life</h2>
           <p>
            Lata Mangeshkar was born on 28 September 1929[17]: 67  in a Maharashtrian Brahmin family[17] in Indore (in the present-day Indore district of Madhya Pradesh and then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India). Her father Deenanath Mangeshkar was a Marathi classical singer and theatre actor. Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), was a Gujarati woman[18] woman from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra). Deenanath's mother belonged to the Devadasis,[19] a matrilineal community of temple artists.[20] Deenanath had taken the surname Mangeshkar, based on the name of his ancestral village Mangeshi.[17] Shevanti was Deenanath's second wife - his first wife Narmada, who had died before his marriage to Shevanti, was Shevanti's older sister.

            Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner. She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.[22]

            Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, भाव बंधन.[23]
            
            She was the eldest child in the family. Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her siblings; all are accomplished singers and musicians.[24]
            
            She received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On her first day of school,[23] Mangeshkar left because she was not allowed to bring her sister Asha along with her.

           <h2>Singing career</h2><br>
           <p>
            In 1942, when Mangeshkar was 13, her father died of heart disease.[26] Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He helped her get started in a career as a singer and actress.[27]

            She sang the song "Naachu Yaa Gade, Khelu Saari Mani Haus Bhaari", which was composed by Sadashivrao Nevrekar for Vasant Joglekar's Marathi movie Kiti Hasaal (1942), but the song was dropped from the final cut.[28] Vinayak gave her a small role in Navyug Chitrapat's Marathi movie Pahili Mangalaa-gaur (1942), in which she sang "Natali Chaitraachi Navalaai" which was composed by Dada Chandekar.[23] Her first Hindi song was "Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya Badal De Tu" for the Marathi film Gajaabhaau (1943).[29] The Bollywood industry was yet to find its feet, so Mangeshkar had to first concentrate on acting, which she didn't like, as the lights and people ordering her around made her feel uncomfortable.[16]
            
            She moved to Mumbai in 1945 when Master Vinayak's company moved its headquarters there. She started taking lessons in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan of Bhindibazaar Gharana.[30][31] She sang "Paa Lagoon Kar Jori" for Vasant Joglekar's Hindi-language movie Aap Ki Seva Mein (1946),[23] which was composed by Datta Davjekar.[32] The dance in the film was performed by Rohini Bhate, who later became a famous classical dancer.[33] Lata and her sister Asha played minor roles in Vinayak's first Hindi-language movie, Badi Maa (1945). In that movie, Lata also sang a bhajan, "Maata Tere Charnon Mein." She was introduced to music director Vasant Desai during the recording of Vinayak's second Hindi-language movie, Subhadra (1946).[

She made her debut in Tamil playback singing with Vanaradham in 1956 (Uran Khotala dubbed in Tamil) with the Tamil song Enthan Kannalan for Nimmi in the dubbed version composed by Naushad.[45]

The song, composed by C. Ramchandra and written by Kavi Pradeep, is said to have brought the Prime Minister to tears.[23][51]
            
            In 1963, she returned to collaborate with S. D. Burman.[52] She had sung in R. D.

            During the 1960s, she continued her association with Madan Mohan, which included the songs "Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha" from Anpadh (1962), "Lag Jaa Gale" and "Naina Barse Rim Jhim" from Woh Kaun Thi? (1964), "Woh Chup Rahen To" from Jahan Ara (1964), "Tu Jahan Jahan Chalega" from Mera Saaya (1966) and "Teri Aankho Ke Siva" from Chirag (1969),[59] and she had a continuing association with the maestros Shankar Jaikishan, who got her to sing in various genres in the 1960s
